# HackorTreat

# Our Idea
We take in info from Craigslist, pennysaver, etc about garage sales and then we figure out the best route for you to take to max the numbers of sales you can go to

# Current Jobs:

Alim: Also look into Craigslist and other shops where you can extract address of the sales using API. + fix my crappy code + look into Radar.io and other route-making APIs

Franz: Look into Craigslist and other shops where you can extract address of the sales using API.

# Steps

1. Retrieve user's physical address from their IP address
2. Find sales in their city and sort by distance
3. Get the addresses of the top 3/5/7 sales (number of sales can be an input if we want)
4. Make a route through all of them
5. Simple UI
6. Profit

# Notes

this seems like a pretty advanced project because we will most likely have to work with JSON responses from Craigslist (maybe not), and some Radar.io usage (locations and maps API that we will definitely use). I have used some of this in the past but probably not to this degree.

I hope u are ready because this seems like a great challenge!
