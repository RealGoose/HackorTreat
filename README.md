# HackorTreat

# Our Idea
We take in info from Craigslist, pennysaver, etc about garage sales and then we figure out the best route for you to take to max the numbers of sales you can go to


# Steps

1. Retrieve user's address from their IP address
2. Find sales in their city and sort by distance
3. Get the addresses of the top 3/5/7 sales (number of sales can be an input if we want)
4. Make a route through all of them
5. Simple UI
6. Profit
